Enron E-mail Graphing
11 November 2012

This is a program for analyzing graphs.

Do not distribute, modify, tweak or in any way alter the code without citing the original authors. Do not use it for any unallowed, illegal, or otherwise nefarious uses.

To run the program, run the appropriate Unix script (such as isloop) in your terminal of choice. connectedcomponents, isloop, and msquare do not take any arguments. shortestpath takes two arguments, the first being the source node index and the second being the destination node index. Please see the assignment sheet for particular documentation on what the methods do.
